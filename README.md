# Word-Guess-Game

A simple Java console-based game where the player tries to guess the hidden country name letter by letter before running out of guesses.

# 🎮 Game Description

This is a word guessing game built in Java.
The program randomly selects a country name, and the player must guess the letters one at a time.
You have 10 chances to guess the word correctly before the game ends.

# ⚙️ How It Works

The program randomly picks a secret word from a list of countries.

The player guesses letters one by one.

If the guess is wrong, one chance is lost.
